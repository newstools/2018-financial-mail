In Fancourt’s first residential release in over a decade, a new phase of vacant stands is being launched in this renowned Garden Route golf estate. Known as "Noem Noem", the new phase comprises 45 stands sized from 500m² to 1,135m². In addition to three Gary Player-designed championship golf courses, Fancourt boasts a five-star boutique hotel, spa and leisure centre, several restaurants, a business centre and a wide range of sports and recreational activities.  This stunning villa in Strathmore Road, in what is one of the Atlantic seaboard’s most desirable residential neighbourhoods, is within walking distance of the beach and offers expansive sea and mountain views. Large entertainment areas flow to the outdoor pool and tropical landscaped garden. Additional features include a separate guest apartment or teenager pad as well as staff accommodation.
