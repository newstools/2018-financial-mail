Asset Forfeiture Unit operational head Knorx Molelle swung into action like an avenging angel, vowing to seize assets worth R50bn looted by the Guptas and their associates. First he pounced on R1.6bn paid by Eskom to consultancies Trillian and McKinsey without a contract. Then he seized a dairy, run by a Gupta IT manager, that was paid R220m in government grants, almost all of it siphoned off to Gupta front companies. Next he should gun for a R5bn kickback for a Transnet locomotive contract. Miracles do happen. Few deserve a week in the national wringer as much as Qedani Mahlangu, the former Gauteng health MEC on whose watch — and decision — 143 vulnerable, mentally ill patients died, many of them from starvation. A number remain unaccounted for. Mahlangu’s "sincere apology" for the Life Esidimeni tragedy rapidly regressed to denials of negligence, while responsibility, it appears, was "collective". May she never again occupy an executive position — anywhere.
