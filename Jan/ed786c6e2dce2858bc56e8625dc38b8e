The topics you have to be able to discuss this week. 1. Fleet fit for a queen An affidavit authorising Grace Mugabe’s son to drive motor vehicles out of Zimbabwe for service in SA and Botswana revealed the extent of the former first lady’s vast wealth. The affidavit confirmed her to be the owner of three luxury vehicles — a Rolls-Royce Ghost, a Porsche and a Range Rover Autobiography. The arrival of the Rolls-Royce Ghost in Zimbabwe late in 2017 sparked a public outcry given its high value, set against the country’s deteriorating economic conditions. 2. Extracting its pound The management of Poundland, the UK discount store chain Steinhoff International acquired for £610m in July 2016, wants to divorce itself from its scandal-ridden parent via a management buyout, according to The Telegraph. The newspaper said Poundland executive chairman Andy Bond, a former Asda CEO, has approached various private equity firms to back a management buyout. This comes as Steinhoff looks to liquidate many investments, including its stake in PSG Group, to find cash in order to stave off a liquidity crunch in Europe as a result of funders pulling their investments in the wake of the firm’s accounting scandal, which has cost investors more than R200bn. 3. Minnie’s mini honour Forty years after her male counterpart, Mickey Mouse, was honoured with a Hollywood Walk of Fame star, Minnie Mouse finally received hers. "I’m so grateful and I want to thank all my friends from around the world. And Mickey, I’m so happy you’re here to share this wonderful day with me," Minnie Mouse said. "This really is the best day ever!" Walt Disney company chairman and CEO Bob Iger, as well as singer Katy Perry were present for the festivities. Many Disney characters received stars before Minnie Mouse did, including Donald Duck, Tinkerbelle, Winnie the Pooh, Snow White and Kermit the Frog.
