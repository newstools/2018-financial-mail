Been a hard day’s night? Eight days a week? Reward yourself with these Happy Socks beauties, inspired by and created to celebrate The Beatles’ Yellow Submarine movie.

As you’d expect, these particular sartorial numbers are bright and fun and feature everything from portraits of the Fab Four to the aforementioned submarine. They’ll (Sgt) pepper your wardrobe with panache, and make a grand gift for the Eleanors, Lucys and Jojos in your life.
