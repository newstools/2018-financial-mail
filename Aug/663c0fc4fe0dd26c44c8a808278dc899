Every month Saverio Cardillo, owner of Joburg’s Bottega Whiskey Club, gives us his tip on a top tipple. August’s pick: Kilkerran Eight-Year-Old Cask Strength. Why? This limited-edition single malt is a perfectly balanced mix of smokiness, perfume, zestiness and sweetness. The deal: The second edition of this delight has a 55.7% cask strength and is produced at the Glengyle Distillery in Campbeltown, on Scotland’s Kintyre Peninsula. Useless but interesting fact: the peninsula’s mull (or headland as we’d call it) is the one Paul McCartney and his band Wings sing about in their hit Mull of Kintyre. Why? Sir Paul owns a farm there. Back to the whisky. In its prime, Campbeltown had more than 30 distilleries. Today there are only three: Glengyle; the famous Springbank, which was founded in 1828; and Glen Scotia. The Kilkerran is a great example of how bigger isn’t always better and that small producers are doing great things. Cardillo says: "It’s also the ideal thing to pair with spare ribs, or a smoky meat like brisket."
