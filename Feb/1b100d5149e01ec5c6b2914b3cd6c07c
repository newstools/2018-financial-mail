At the next event in the Financial Mail Private Lounge series, presented in partnership with the Gautrain Management Agency, we’ll take inspiration from the agency’s efforts to provide top-class public transport while keeping the three Ps of sustainability at its core: people, planet and profit. How do we do more to create more jobs, improve infrastructure and grow SA’s economy for everyone’s benefit – now and in the future? It takes both good business and positive governance to sustain the growth of an environment, the economy and society as a whole. The Gautrain Management Agency’s goal is to facilitate continued growth within SA’s biggest economic engine by considering the relationship between transport, people and their daily commutes while reducing the province’s overall carbon footprint and addressing other pitfalls linked to heavy traffic.
