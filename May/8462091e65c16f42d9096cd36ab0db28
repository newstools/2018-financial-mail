Whether they’re soft and voluptuous or spiky and with a certain edge, SA’s melange of succulents is a thing to love. It’s no surprise then that Joburg contemporary jewellery gallery Veronica Anderson Jewellery has taken inspiration from these water-wise beauties for its latest collection. A host of top local jewellery designers has created a bevy of rings, pendants and earrings that speak to the theme, so there’s bound to be something for everyone — whatever your style may be. veronicaandersonjewellery.co.za
