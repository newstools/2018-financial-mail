We don’t need to say much more than that these earrings from local hotshot jeweller Kirsten Goss are damned fine. They’re part of her Vay-Kay collection and were created with summer holidays in mind, though they will obviously look good when paired with your après-ski kit too (cue wretched seasonal depression as autumn approaches). Buy them for yourself or for someone you’re really trying to impress. Visit kirstengoss.com
