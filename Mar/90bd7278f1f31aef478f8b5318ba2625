The German fashion house, known for its suiting, makes more than half its menswear sales from casual styles, about 40% from formal wear and about 10% from shoes. New CEO Mark Langer has sought to return the company to its roots, selling premium men’s clothing with a modern edge. 2. Uber bets on Kohli Cab-hailing platform Uber has appointed India’s cricket captain, Virat Kohli, as its first brand ambassador in the country, as it pins its hopes on the Asia Pacific region. Uber has pumped millions into the Indian market as it goes head-to-head against Bangalore-based rival Ola. Last month, Uber named footballer Mohamed Salah as its brand ambassador for the Egyptian market. 3. KFC returns to former supplier KFC is returning to former supplier Bidvest for more than one-third of its UK restaurants after its disastrous switch to DHL caused chicken shortages that forced the temporary closure of 900 outlets. KFC, owned by Yum! Brands, overhauled its UK supply chain last year. 4.
