As Warren Buffett says, it’s the most important decision you’ll ever make. If you found a lottery ticket that had won $100m, what would you do with it?

Occasionally to convince my daughter to go to sleep, otherwise there’s no need. Do you own bitcoin? And why? No. I always prefer to understand where value is derived from, and that’s a bit difficult with bitcoin. How much was your first pay cheque, and what did you do with it? I had to pay a deposit and rent for an apartment. Name a place you’ve been to that lived up to the hype. Barcelona. What was your most recent purchase? Flight tickets. What’s the worst investment you’ve made? Buying into some oil counters 10 years ago on the back of Goldman Sachs predicting that the oil price would hit $200/barrel. What was your first job?
