Sugaring the pill? Takeda Pharmaceutical shares lost almost 5% of their value on Friday as investors fretted over the size of the deal the Japanese company would have to make to seal its record-breaking purchase of Shire Plc. Shire has rejected Takeda’s US$63bn cash-and-stock conditional offer, saying the offer — and two previous offers — significantly undervalued its growth prospects and drugs in development. The rare-disease drug maker says talks to determine "whether a further, more attractive, proposal may be forthcoming" will continue. A successful bid would propel the company into the top ranks of global drug makers in Japan’s largest-ever outbound deal.

Investors have for some time circled Pinnacle, which makes Duncan Hines baking mixes and Vlasic Pickles, and some have hoped for a merger. Reuters
