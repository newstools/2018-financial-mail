1. Trading blows China’s tariff retaliation China has unveiled duties of up to 25% on US food imports including pork, fruit, nuts and wine in retaliation for new steel and aluminium tariffs instituted by Donald Trump’s administration, the Financial Times reports. The duties on 128 US products will "safeguard China’s interests and balance the losses caused" by the higher US tariffs, Beijing says. China runs a trade surplus with the US, which means it has a lot to lose in the advent of an all-out trade war. The new duties are a response to higher tariffs, not the 25% levy on up to US$60bn of annual imports from China that Trump has said is coming. That leaves open the prospect that Beijing could produce a tougher response in the future. 2.

The study doesn’t show, for example, whether someone’s cortisol would increase again before they decided they were missing out and returned to the site.
