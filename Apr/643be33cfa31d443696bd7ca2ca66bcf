Each month, Saverio Cardillo, owner of Joburg’s Bottega Whiskey Club, gives us his tip on the top tipple to get your hands on. April’s pick: Redbreast 12-year-old Whiskey. Why? This is the big daddy of single pot still Irish whiskey. The deal: Single pot still whiskey is not only unique to the Emerald Isle, it’s specific to a particular spot: the Midleton Distillery in County Cork. So it’s properly Irish, to be sure. The guys at Midleton — the largest whiskey distillery in the country — magic up this 12-year-old delight from a mash of malted and unmalted barley, which is then triple-distilled in a gigantic, traditional copper-pot still. The finished product is pretty much considered to be the definitive Irish whiskey. Pedigree aside, this elegant little pick-me-up will make you smile. It’s buttery, rich and has subtle spicy elements. It’s like a heavenly morsel of burnt brioche that you’ll want to enjoy with a bit of smoked bacon and some maple syrup.

The winner will be notified by us and have the prize delivered to his or her door. It’s as easy as that.
